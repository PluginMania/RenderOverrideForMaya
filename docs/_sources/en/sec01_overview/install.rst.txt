1. Download the installer from AutodeskAppStore.

   * Trial version is available without payment. (A watermark will appear on the screen.)
   * The paid version is a yearly subscription contract.

     * The only difference between the trial version and the paid version is whether the watermark is displayed on the screen or not.
     * The functions other than the watermark are the same, so please use the paid version after confirming the operation with the trial version.
