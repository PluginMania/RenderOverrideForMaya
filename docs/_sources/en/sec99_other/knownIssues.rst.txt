When multiple Grids are set, some of them are not displayed.
************************************************************

* The following two grids will not be drawn unless specified at the beginning.

  * ``Golden Spiral(A)``
  * ``Golden Spiral(B)`` (Mirror)

    .. figure:: ../../_images/gridTroubleA.png
       :alt: gridTroubleA

       (``Golden Spiral(A)`` is set to second, so it will not appear in the view)


* The reason is that the drawing process is different from other Grids.
* Please change the order in which Grids are drawn.

    .. figure:: ../../_images/gridTroubleB.png
       :alt: gridTroubleB

       (If ``Golden Spiral(A)`` is specified at the beginning, it will be displayed in the view.)
