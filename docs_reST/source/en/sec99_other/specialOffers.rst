How to install/remove a new version
***********************************

Install
============

* If you are already using RenderOverride and **Auto Load** in **Plug-in Manager** is checked, uncheck it.

  * Uncheck this box in advance to prevent conflicts between the already installed executable and the new version (test program) executable.
  * No need to uninstall

* Newer versions of the program files will be shared separately, zipped

  * Unzip the distributed zip file

* In the extracted folder, you will find a folder named ``RenderOverrideNewFeature[VERSION]``. (The name of this folder is such that it will not be covered by the folder you installed from the AutodeskAppStore.)

* Copy the ``RenderOverrideNewFeature[VERSION]`` folder to ``C:/ProgramData/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins/``.
* After copying, start Maya and check the **Plug-in Manager** for the ``RenderOverrideNewFeature[VERSION]`` item and load it.

  * Once successfully loaded, you can use it just like the regular production version

   * (``C:/ProgramData/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins/``)
